# Introductory Researching

## Task - Introduction

The most importatnt quality for a hacker to have is the ability to research effectively. Hacking requires a vast knowledge base since you need to understand the thing
you are attempting to break into. No one in this world knows everything. Everyone encounters issued where they don't know how to solve. Research comes into play since
no one is just handed all the answeres to questions.

As experience increases, things will be a bit more difficult to research. In information security, there will never coma  point where you don't need to look things up.
Never.
