I can use the "Learn" page to find cyber security labs, challenges and learning paths.

Some tasks contain machines I can start, which are used to put my knowledge into practice.

# Starting my first machine

I need to start the machine, access the deployed machin by the AttackBox or via OpenVPN and then put my knowledge into use by hacking real-world machines.

I will start my AttackBox and this is what I will use to access target machines I start on tasks such as this one. Once I start the target machine I wait 1 minute for it to configure.

I need to Copy the IP Address of the machine and then open FF and paste the IP address into the URL bar.

I've opened FF and placed the IP address of the room machine into the AttackBox. I see the flag at the bottom of the page, flag{connection_verified}.
