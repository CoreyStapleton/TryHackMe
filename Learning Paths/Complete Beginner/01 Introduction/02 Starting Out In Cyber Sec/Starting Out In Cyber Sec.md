# Starting Out in Cyber Sec

## Task 1 - Welcome To TryHackMe

This room just gives a brief overview on the diff career paths in Cyber Sec.

There are structured learning activities in the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/paths">learning paths</a> area. 
If you have a good idea on the different career tracks in the Cyber Sec industry, then I could head over to <a href="https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities">Hacktivities</a> page for different walkthroughs.

## Task 2 - Offensive Security

The offensive side of Cyber Sec is the largest. It involves attacking applications and technologies to unearth vulnerabiltites to exploit.
This career is mainly for individuals who enjoy understanding how things work, who are very analytical and mostly think outside of the box.

Being a penetration tester is the most common offensive security job role. This individual is typically legally employed by an organization to find vulerabilities in certain applications and the like.
A pen tester usually has a broad range of knowledge lik web applicaiton security, network security and the use of programming languages in order to write various scripts.

Cloud security has been gainin gpopularity more recently as various orgs are now shofting their infrastructure to cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

It's a good idea to have broad knowledge when starting out but you can definately focus on one thing and have a speciality.

To help build the foundation of having this broad knowledge, TryHackMe has the <a href="">beginer pathway</a> that covers mosft of the previously mentioned areas. You can also go
to the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities">Hacktivities</a> page and search for various topics.

## Task 3 - Defensive Security

This is the second major area when it comes to Cyber Sec. This area is involved in detecting and stopping attacks. Individuals in this career track are typically analytical and
enjoy problem solving.

Being a Security Analyst is one career that is on the Defensive Security side of it. This person's focus is to monitor various systems in the org and detect whether any of these
systems are being attackd. Understanding what an attack looks like on various technologies and how to detect that is very important. You can use the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk">Detect Attacks Using Splunk</a> room to learn more about this.

If a Security Analyst deals with detecting attacks then, Incident Responders typically handle once an attack has already happened. Incident Responders mainly focus on understanding
what actions the attacker took within the org and what the impact of those actions are gong to be. They also need to understand what additional attacks can be done on a system. They
also analyze the artifacts and trace evidence left behind from an attack, if any. You can use the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bpvolatility">Analyze Memory To Trace An Attackers Actions Using Volatility</a> room to learn more about this.

Another role in the Cyber Defese side of Cyber Sec is a Malware Analyst. Malicious actors use malicious software in their attacks and knowing what exactly the malware is doing, 
can better assist in preventing further abuse and also to identify the malicious action that was taken. You can learn more about this from the following rooms:
<a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/malmalintroductory">Introduction to Malware Analysis</a>, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/malresearching">Researching and Identifying Malware</a>, and <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/malstrings">Identifying String in Malicious Applications</a>.

The <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/blueteam">Cyber Defense</a> pathway covers a lot of skills, tools and methods that would be needed for an entry Blue Team role.
